## Daily Scrums (Dev Team)

- The team continued to use the Discord Server for the dev team to discuss progress, goals as well as bugs etc.
- Each team member shares what they worked on for the previous day, what they plan to work on today & any issues (roadblocks) that need to be addressed.
- The scrum master ensured that the team worked smoothly, stayed on track & made progress towards our goals
- Video calls were also setup to facilitate better communication and collaboration. With team members working in different locations, video calls provide a way to bring everyone together in a virtual space. This allows the team to discuss progress, share updates & identify any issues that need to be addressed in real-time. Additionally, video calls enable the team to build stronger relationships with each other, even if they are not physically in the same location. By using video calls in our daily scrums and other meetings, we are able to work more efficiently and effectively as a team.
